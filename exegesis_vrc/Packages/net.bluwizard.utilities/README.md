# BluWizard's Editor Utilities

This repository contains some fixes to some strange behaviours in Unity. It's not much, but this repository will evolve with more helper scripts as time goes on.

# [📦 Add Editor Utilities to Creator Companion](https://vpm.bluwizard.net/)

## Current Features:
- Curve Editor Fix: Fixes an annoying issue when opening the Curve editor that causes it to be sized obsurdly too large.
- Find Emission Animations: Created to help a friend find Animation Clips that are interfering with their Emission properties on Poiyomi materials when they were not supposed to (even though they weren't tagged!)
